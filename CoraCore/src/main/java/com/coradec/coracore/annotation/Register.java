/**
 * Registers the annotated class with the registry specified in the annotation parameter.  The
 * annotated class will be added to the specified registry upon loading ONLY IF it is also annotated
 * as {@link Implementation}.
 * <p>
 * The typical use case for this annotation are components of a hierarchy acting as implementations
 * for a hierarchy of interfaces in a parallel universe.  These implementation classes will be found
 * and initialized by the CarClassLoader due to their @Implementation annotation, but would be very
 * hard to locate and address unless being registered in a common registry.
 * <p>
 * The annotation has been introduced to create GUI implementations implementing a particular type
 * of gadget.
